Introduction
------------

Welcome to Harry Potter Memory! Test your concentration and match the pairs of characters on the cards to win!



How to Play
-----------

The board will begin with a 4x4 grid of cards face-down. Click 2 cards at random to flip them over and reveal the character. If you match, they will be removed. If they do not match, keep trying! Match all the cards before the time runs out in order to move on to the next level.

As you increase levels, the game board will grow! Beat all three levels to become an HP memory witch/wizard!
