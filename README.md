Introduction
------------

Welcome to Harry Potter Memory! Test your concentration and match the pairs of characters on the cards to win.


How to Play/User Stories
------------------------

Click the cards to turn them over and reveal the character. Choose two cards to determine if the characters match. If they match â€” 10 points to Gryffindor! Keep going. If they don't -- keep trying until they all match! The game is over and the board resets when you get all the matches.
